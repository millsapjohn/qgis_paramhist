# QGIS Parameter History

Adds a panel to the main QGIS interface where processing history is displayed in a more readable format, specifically highlighting the parameters used.<br>

Double clicking an entry in the history list will re-launch the algorithm with the same parameters; history can be searched by keyword or filtered by timestamp. The history entry can be copied to the clipboard.
